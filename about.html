            An artist with an extraordinary fascination in the combination of the auditory and visual arts is the way to describe Max Garcia-Andrews as a composer. He has acquired an expansive amount of experience with many genres through performances as a bassist. He has been involved in programs such as the Berklee School of Music 5 Week Performance Intensive program, with a focus on the funk/fusion genre. Max was a finalist performer for an international competition adjudicated by the Association of Music for International Schools. Not long after graduating high school, Max became an adjudicator for the same competition, giving advice to young aspiring musicians on how to improve as a performer. He has recently been commissioned by the Denver University First Edition (DUFE) acapella group  to arrange original pop music derived from female artists. Max is currently writing music for and producing a short film with a Denver University colleague to submit in a future short film festival. He has been described to compose contemporary impressionist music and aspires one day to be a film scorer.
